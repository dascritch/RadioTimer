# RadioTimer
HTML5 time tracking for radio broadcast recording sessions

RadioTimer helps you see how far you are in your notes exported from an Etherpad instance, or any other text you paste to it that is formated with H1 and H2 tags.

Here you can see an Etherpad instance hosted by Framasoft, RadioTimer's default page, and a running instance on the exported etherpad content.
